# xml_sax [![crates.io](https://img.shields.io/crates/v/xml_sax.svg)](https://crates.io/crates/xml_sax)

You don't need to add this library to your dependencies.

Currently, only xml_oxide library implements this library and it is copied inside the library.

After failed experiments I settled with a pull parser. If you want to use xml_sax interface to implement another parser we can discuss to improve the interface and options for having a single interface & multiple implementations.
